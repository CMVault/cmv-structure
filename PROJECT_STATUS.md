# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault


## Last Updated: August 10, 2025 at 1:32 PM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- ❌ **DATABASE MIGRATION ISSUES** - Multiple attempts to migrate to 160+ field schema
- 🔧 Camera table has issues with missing columns and structure problems
- ⚠️ Migration scripts failing due to various SQL constraints and errors
- 🛑 Need different approach - current migration strategy not working


## ✅ Completed Today:
- **Discovery System Fixed**:
  - Fixed function scope issues
  - System can now generate mock cameras
  - Discovery runs without crashing
  
- **Migration Attempts**:
  - Created multiple migration scripts
  - Identified database has 73 columns but missing key fields
  - Added missing columns like release_year successfully
  - Generated slugs for existing 6 cameras


## 🔄 In Progress:
- Database migration from partial schema to comprehensive 160+ field schema
- Trying to preserve existing 6 cameras while upgrading structure
- Dealing with SQL constraint errors and table conflicts


## ❌ Still Need:
- **URGENT**: Successfully complete database migration
- Get comprehensive schema working with compatibility view
- Test discovery system with new schema
- Implement real web scraping to replace mock data
- Manual PDF integration system
- Admin dashboard for camera management
- Camera comparison tool
- User authentication system
- Production database (cameras in films)
- API documentation


## 🐛 Active Issues:
| Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Database migration failing | 🔴 CRITICAL | Can't use 160+ field schema |
| SQL constraint errors | 🔴 CRITICAL | Migration scripts crash |
| View creation conflicts | 🔴 CRITICAL | Compatibility layer broken |
| Camera viewer not working | ⚠️ Medium | Can't verify data |


## 📁 Files Changed Today:
- `unified-camera-system.js` - Fixed and working for discovery
- `safe-database-fix.js` - Successfully added missing columns
- `migrate-to-comprehensive.js` - Failed due to slug constraints
- `fixed-migrate-to-comprehensive.js` - Failed due to table conflicts
- `cleanup-and-migrate.js` - Failed with TypeError
- `simple-migrate.js` - Status unknown
- `view-cameras.js` - Created but not working


## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: **Try a different migration approach or consider starting fresh with proper schema**


## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- **Migration Alternatives**:
  - Export existing 6 cameras to JSON
  - Drop all tables and recreate with proper schema
  - Import cameras back from JSON
  - Use a different database migration tool
  - Consider PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for better migration support

- **Core Features** (AFTER fixing database):
  - Camera Timeline showing evolution of each brand
  - Camera comparison tool (select 2-3 cameras side by side)
  - User accounts with saved favorites
  - Camera recommendation quiz
  - Professional photographer interviews
  - Gear insurance calculator
  - Lens database with mount compatibility
  - Price history tracking
  - Stock availability checker


## 📝 Important Notes:
- **DATABASE IS IN UNSTABLE STATE** - Multiple migration attempts left artifacts
- Have 6 cameras: Canon EOS R5, Canon EOS R6 Mark II, Nikon Z9, Nikon Z8, Sony A7R V, Sony A7 IV
- Cameras table has 73 columns (partially migrated state)
- Multiple backup tables and views may exist
- Need to clean up database before next attempt


## 🏆 What Actually Works vs What Doesn't:
| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Discovery System | ✅ Works | Can generate mock cameras |
| Database Connection | ✅ Works | SQLite connects |
| Basic Camera Table | ⚠️ Partial | Has data but wrong schema |
| 160+ Field Schema | ❌ BROKEN | Migration keeps failing |
| Compatibility View | ❌ BROKEN | Can't create due to conflicts |
| Data Viewer | ❌ BROKEN | Scripts not showing data |


## 📊 Current Database State:
```
Tables found:
- cameras (73 columns, 6 records)
- camera_firmware (0 records)
- camera_productions (0 records)
- camera_reviews (0 records)
- camera_samples (0 records)
- image_attributions (0 records)
- image_cache (0 records)

Issues:
- Missing release_year column (fixed)
- Missing slug column (fixed)
- Can't create cameras_comprehensive due to conflicts
- Can't create compatibility view
```


## 🎬 Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check current tables
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db ".tables"

# Check camera count
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cameras;"

# Export cameras to JSON (backup before next attempt)
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db ".mode json" ".once cameras-backup.json" "SELECT * FROM cameras;"

# Check if comprehensive table exists
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='cameras_comprehensive';"

# Check PM2 processes
npx pm2 list
```


## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Backup existing cameras to JSON**
2. **Drop all tables and start fresh**
3. **Create proper 160+ field schema from scratch**
4. **Import the 6 cameras back**
5. **Test with discovery system**

**Status: DATABASE MIGRATION BLOCKED - Need different approach** 😞
