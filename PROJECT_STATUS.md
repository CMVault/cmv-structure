  - Fixed all column name mismatches (snake_case → camelCase)
  - Built automated migration for existing data
  - Created proper indexes for performance

- **Automation System Fixed**:
  - Created `automation-adapter.js` to handle data conversion
  - Built `cmv-automation-fixed.js` with integrated adapter
  - Successfully processes all 20+ cameras
  - Placeholder image system working
  - Proper database saves with new schema

- **Schema Features Added**:
  - Complete sensor specifications (size, type, megapixels, crop factor)
  - Full autofocus system details (points, coverage, sensitivity)
  - Comprehensive video specs (4K/8K, frame rates, bit depth)
  - Pro features (dual native ISO, waveforms, false color)
  - Build quality (weather sealing, materials, dimensions)
  - Battery and power specifications
  - Complete connectivity options
  - Price tracking (MSRP, current, used)
  - Production tracking system
  - User review system
  - Sample image galleries
  - Firmware history tracking


## 🔄 In Progress:
- Verifying camera data in database
