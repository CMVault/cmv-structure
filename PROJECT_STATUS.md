# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault


## Last Updated: August 4, 2025 at 11:24 AM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- ✅ Identified database column issue: `localImagePath` not `imageLocal`
- ✅ Created image updater script
- ⚠️ First run found only 1 camera needing images (Hasselblad 500C/M)
- ❌ Failed due to "/" in model name causing path error
- ✅ Fixed script to handle special characters in model names
- ✅ Created diagnostic script to check image status
- 🔄 Ready to run diagnostic and re-run updater


## ✅ Completed Today:
- **Database Schema Discovery**:
  - Found correct image columns: `localImagePath`, `imageUrl`, `imageAttribution`
  - Database uses 164 columns with specific naming convention
  - Column 143: `localImagePath` (not `imageLocal`)
  - Column 142: `imageUrl` 
  - Column 147: `imageAttribution`

- **Image System Development**:
  - Created `update-camera-images.js` with correct column names
  - Generates branded placeholder images with brand colors
  - Fixed path handling for special characters (/ in model names)
  - Created `check-image-status.js` diagnostic tool
  - Updates database with proper paths
  - Creates attribution files for legal compliance

- **Issues Discovered & Fixed**:
  - Only 1 camera found needing images (investigating why)
  - Hasselblad 500C/M has "/" in name causing path error
  - Fixed with regex: `replace(/[\s\/]+/g, '-')`
  - Updated query to catch more cases (empty strings, bad paths)

- **Previous Achievements**:
  - Fixed camera display issues
  - Database has 164 columns with comprehensive camera data
  - PM2 running both server and automation
  - 48 cameras total in database
  - All API endpoints functional
  - Server running on port 3000


## 🔄 In Progress:
- Running diagnostic to understand current image status
- Need to determine why only 1/48 cameras flagged as needing images
- Ready to re-run updater with fixes


## ❌ Still Need:
- Run diagnostic script to see actual image status
- Re-run image updater with fixes
- Implement real image downloading from B&H Photo
- Update camera detail page to show all 164 fields
- Manual PDF upload system
- Admin dashboard for camera management
- Camera comparison tool
- User authentication system
- Production database (which cameras used in which films)
- User reviews and ratings
- Camera rig builder


## 🐛 Active Issues:
- Unclear why only 1 camera needed images (expected 48)
- Need to check if other 47 already have paths set
- Special characters in model names need sanitization
- Camera detail page needs update to show all fields
- Some cameras missing key data (megapixels, sensor size)


## 📁 Files Changed:
- Created: `update-camera-images.js` ✅
- Created: `check-image-status.js` ✅
- Created: `real-image-scraper.js` ✅
- Created: `cmv-automation-real-images.js` ✅
- Fixed: Special character handling ✅
- Updated: SQL query to catch more cases ✅

## 📊 Quick Commands:
```bash
# Run diagnostic first
node check-image-status.js

# Check database directly
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(localImagePath) as with_path, COUNT(CASE WHEN localImagePath LIKE '%placeholder%' THEN 1 END) as placeholders FROM cameras;"

# See sample of current paths
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT brand, model, localImagePath FROM cameras LIMIT 5;"

# Run updated image script
node update-camera-images.js

# Check created images
ls -la public/images/cameras/*.jpg 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# Check PM2 status
npx pm2 status
