# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault


## Last Updated: August 4, 2025 at 10:30 AM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- ✅ CMV system running with PM2
- ✅ Automation successfully scraped 23 cameras
- ❌ Camera page showing 404 error for /api/cameras
- 🔄 Need to verify server-minimal.js has API routes


## ✅ Completed Today:
- **Complete System Launch**:
  - PM2 installed and running both processes
  - Server running on port 3000
  - Automation completed first run - 23 cameras added
  - Database has 48 cameras total (0 errors)

- **Database Revolution**:
  - Created ultimate schema with 130+ camera fields
  - 164 columns confirmed in database
  - Added 5 related tables (productions, reviews, samples, firmware, attributions)
  - Fixed all column name issues
  - Built migration system for existing data
  - Created comprehensive indexes

- **Automation System Success**:
  - Built `automation-adapter.js` for schema compatibility
  - Created `cmv-automation-fixed.js` with proper save logic
  - Fixed placeholder image system
  - Automation running perfectly - 0 errors!
  - Saved cameras including Nikon F3 and Canon AE-1

- **Server Separation Complete**:
  - Created `server-minimal.js` without automation
  - Created `automation-scheduler.js` for 6-hour updates
  - Created PM2 ecosystem config
  - Both processes running independently

- **Process Management**:
  - cmv-server: ONLINE (running server-minimal.js)
  - cmv-automation: ONLINE (scheduled every 6 hours)
  - Both processes stable under PM2


## 🔄 In Progress:
- Debugging 404 error on /api/cameras endpoint
- Need to verify server-minimal.js exists and has routes


## ❌ Still Need:
- Fix API routes for camera page
- Set up Google Images API for real camera images
- Implement real image scraping APIs
- Add B&H Photo integration
- Create admin dashboard
- Add manual PDF uploads
- Implement camera comparison tool
- Add user authentication system


## 🐛 Active Issues:
- **404 Error**: /api/cameras endpoint not found
- Camera page cannot load camera data
- Need to check if server-minimal.js was properly saved
- Using placeholder images (Google Images API not configured)


## 📁 Files Changed:
- Created: `server-minimal.js` ❓ (need to verify)
- Created: `automation-scheduler.js` ✅ 
- Created: `ecosystem.config.js` ✅
- Created: `start-cmv.sh` ✅
- Updated: `package.json` ✅
- Created: `ultimate-schema-fix.js` ✅
- Created: `automation-adapter.js` ✅
- Created: `cmv-automation-fixed.js` ✅


## 💡 Next Session:
Start with:
1. Check if server-minimal.js exists: `ls -la server-minimal.js`
2. If missing, save from artifact
3. Verify API routes exist: `grep -n "\/api\/cameras" server-minimal.js`
4. Restart server: `npx pm2 restart cmv-server`
5. Test API: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/cameras`
6. Once API works, update cameras.html if needed

npx pm2 status

# View server logs
npx pm2 logs cmv-server

# View automation logs
npx pm2 logs cmv-automation

# Restart server
npx pm2 restart cmv-server

# Monitor everything
npx pm2 monit

# Stop everything

## 🔧 Immediate Action Required:
The server is running but the API routes are returning 404. This means either:
1. server-minimal.js doesn't exist
2. server-minimal.js exists but doesn't have the API routes
3. The routes are defined differently

**Next Step**: Run these debug commands in order:
```bash
# 1. Check if file exists
ls -la server-minimal.js

# 2. If it exists, check for API routes
grep -n "\/api\/cameras" server-minimal.js

# 3. If no routes found, save the file from artifact
# 4. Then restart
npx pm2 restart cmv-server
```
