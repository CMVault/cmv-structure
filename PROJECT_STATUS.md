# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault


## Last Updated: August 4, 2025 at 10:50 AM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- ✅ Fixed camera display issue - data now showing correctly
- ✅ API endpoint working properly 
- ✅ All 48 cameras displaying with proper formatting
- 🔄 Next: Set up real camera images


## ✅ Completed Today:
- **Fixed Camera Display Issues**:
  - Identified data structure mismatch between database and frontend
  - Database has 164 columns with comprehensive camera data
  - Frontend was expecting simplified structure
  - Created new cameras.html that properly handles database format
  - Cameras now display with brand, model, specs, and manual links

- **Complete System Launch**:
  - PM2 installed and running both processes
  - Server running on port 3000 (using server.js)
  - Automation completed first run - 23 cameras added
  - Database has 48 cameras total (0 errors)

- **Database Revolution**:
  - Created ultimate schema with 130+ camera fields
  - 164 columns confirmed in database
  - Added 5 related tables (productions, reviews, samples, firmware, attributions)
  - Fixed all column name issues
  - Built migration system for existing data
  - Created comprehensive indexes

- **Automation System Success**:
  - Built `automation-adapter.js` for schema compatibility
  - Created `cmv-automation-fixed.js` with proper save logic
  - Fixed placeholder image system
  - Automation running perfectly - 0 errors!
  - Saved cameras including Nikon F3 and Canon AE-1

- **Server Separation Complete**:
  - Created `server-minimal.js` without automation
  - Created `automation-scheduler.js` for 6-hour updates
  - Created PM2 ecosystem config
  - Both processes running independently

- **Process Management**:
  - cmv-server: ONLINE (running server.js)
  - cmv-automation: ONLINE (scheduled every 6 hours)
  - Both processes stable under PM2

- **Documentation System**:
  - Generated complete file structure documentation
  - Created API routes map
  - Built CSS guide with all classes and variables
  - Documented all 135 files in the project


## 🔄 In Progress:
