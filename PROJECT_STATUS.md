# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault


## Last Updated: August 10, 2025 at 2:43 PM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- ✅ **CAMERAS DISPLAYING!** - All 6 cameras now show on the page
- ⚠️ **MISSING SPECS** - Camera details/specs not showing properly
- 🎯 **NEXT**: Fix camera detail pages and spec display
- 🎯 **THEN**: Implement real web scraping for actual camera data


## ✅ Completed Today:
- **MAJOR CLEANUP SUCCESSFUL**:
  - Archived 100+ unnecessary fix/migration files to `archive/` folder
  - Reduced file count from 290 to ~30 essential files
  - Cleaned up all backup directories and temporary files
  
- **DATABASE FIXED**:
  - Created fresh database with simple working schema
  - Successfully imported 6 cameras (Canon R5, R6 II, Nikon Z9, Z8, Sony A7R V, A7 IV)
  - Fixed column name mismatch (lastUpdated vs updated_at)
  - Database queries working properly
  
- **API WORKING**:
  - `/api/cameras` endpoint returns all 6 cameras in JSON
  - `/api/stats` endpoint returns correct counts
  - Server running stable on port 3001
  
- **FRONTEND PARTIALLY WORKING**:
  - Cameras page loads and displays all 6 cameras
  - Stats showing correctly (6 cameras, 3 brands, 0 manuals)
  - Camera cards displaying with placeholder images
  - Navigation working


## 🔄 In Progress:
- Camera detail pages showing "undefined" for specs
- Missing proper camera specifications in display
- Need to populate description and other fields


## ❌ Still Need:
- **Immediate**:
  - Fix camera spec display on cards
  - Fix camera detail pages
  - Add real camera images
  - Add manual PDFs
  
- **Core Features**:
  - Real web scraping implementation
  - Image downloading and caching
  - Manual PDF storage system
  - Admin dashboard
  - Camera comparison tool
  - User authentication
  - Production database (cameras used in films)


## 🐛 Active Issues:
| Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Camera specs show "Year Unknown" | ⚠️ Medium | Release year not displaying |
| Detail page shows "undefined" | ⚠️ Medium | Missing data on detail view |
| No real images | ℹ️ Low | Using placeholders |
| No manual PDFs | ℹ️ Low | Feature not implemented |


## 📁 Current File Structure:
**Essential Files Active:**
- `server.js` - Main server (running on port 3001)
- `unified-camera-system.js` - Automation system
- `automation-routes.js` - API routes
- `camera-utils.js` - Utility functions
- `/public` - Frontend files (cameras.html working!)
- `/data/camera-vault.db` - Database with 6 cameras
- PM2 managing processes

**Archived Files:**
- 100+ fix scripts moved to `archive/` folder
- Can be deleted once system stable for 24 hours


## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: **Fix camera spec display on cards and detail pages**


## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- **Immediate Fixes Needed**:
  - Map database fields to frontend display properly
  - Add more detailed descriptions for each camera
  - Implement placeholder image system with brand logos
  
- **Scraping Targets Identified**:
  - B&H Photo for prices and specs
  - DPReview for detailed specifications
  - Manufacturer sites for manual PDFs
  - YouTube API for review videos
  
- **Feature Ideas**:
  - Camera Timeline showing evolution
  - Comparison tool (2-3 cameras side by side)
  - User accounts with favorites
  - Camera recommendation quiz
  - Professional photographer interviews
  - Gear insurance calculator
  - Lens database with compatibility
  - Price history tracking
  - Stock availability checker


## 📝 Important Notes:
- **SERVER RUNNING ON PORT 3001** (not 3000)
- Access site at: **http://localhost:3001**
- Database has 6 cameras with basic info
- API fully functional at `/api/cameras`
- Frontend needs data mapping fixes
- Ready for real scraping implementation after UI fixes
