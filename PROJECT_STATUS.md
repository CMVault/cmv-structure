## 📊 Database Debugging Commands:
```bash
# Check if cameras table exists
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db ".tables"

# Check actual column names
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "PRAGMA table_info(cameras);"

# Look for image-related columns
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "PRAGMA table_info(cameras);" | grep -i image

# Check if localImagePath exists
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE name='cameras';"

# Quick fix if column missing
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "ALTER TABLE cameras ADD COLUMN localImagePath TEXT;"

# See first few cameras
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT id, brand, model FROM cameras LIMIT 5;"

# Count total cameras
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cameras;"

pm2 restart cmv-discovery
```


### Option 2: Check actual column names
```bash
# See what image columns exist
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db ".schema cameras" | grep -i image
```
