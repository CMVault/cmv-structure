## 🔄 In Progress:

## ❌ Still Need:
- Fix update-structure.yml workflow (98 failed runs)
- Connect frontend to database
- Implement real web scraping
- Add search functionality
- Create camera detail pages


## 🐛 Active Issues:
- **GitHub Action Failing**: update-structure.yml
  - 98 failed workflow runs
  - Likely looking for deleted files
  - Needs to be fixed or disabled


## 📁 Current Status:
- **Scraper**: Working ✅
- **Database**: 2 cameras ✅
- **Images**: 4 files downloaded ✅
- **GitHub**: Synced but workflow failing ⚠️


## 💡 Next Session Priority:
1. Fix or disable update-structure.yml workflow
2. Connect /api/cameras endpoint
3. Display cameras on homepage


## 🚀 Quick Fix for Next Session:


### Check the workflow:
```bash
cat .github/workflows/update-structure.yml
```


### Likely fix needed:
```bash
# Either disable it:
mv .github/workflows/update-structure.yml .github/workflows/update-structure.yml.disabled

# Or delete it:
rm .github/workflows/update-structure.yml

# Then commit:
git add .
git commit -m "Fix failing workflow"
git push
```


## 🏗️ What's Working:
- ✅ Camera scraper
- ✅ Image downloads
- ✅ Database operations
- ✅ Thumbnail generation
- ✅ Attribution system


## 📊 End of Day Stats:
- **Cameras Scraped**: 2
- **Images Downloaded**: 4
- **Database Size**: 28KB
- **Issues Fixed**: 10+
- **Issues Remaining**: 1 (workflow)


## 🎯 Tomorrow's Action Plan:
1. **Fix GitHub Workflow** (5 minutes)
   - Check what update-structure.yml does
   - Fix or disable it
   
2. **Connect Frontend** (30 minutes)
   - Update server.js API endpoints
   - Test /api/cameras
   
3. **Display Cameras** (1 hour)
   - Update homepage JavaScript
   - Ensure images load
   
4. **Start Real Scraping** (2 hours)
   - Research B&H Photo structure
   - Implement first real scraper


## 💾 Backup Reminder:
- Local files: ✅ Saved
- GitHub: ✅ Pushed (except workflow fix)
- Database: ✅ Working


## 🚦 Overall Status: YELLOW
- Core functionality: GREEN ✅
- GitHub workflows: RED ❌
- Ready for next phase after workflow fix


## 📝 Notes for Next Session:
The update-structure.yml workflow is trying to run scripts/generate-structure.js which we deleted. This workflow seems to auto-generate documentation. You need to either:
1. Disable the workflow (easiest)
2. Update it to not use deleted files
3. Delete it entirely if not needed


## 🎉 Today's Achievement:
Built a working camera scraper from scratch, overcame multiple technical challenges, and established a solid foundation for the Camera Manual Vault project!
