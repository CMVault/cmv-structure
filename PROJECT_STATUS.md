# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault


## Last Updated: August 1, 2025 at 4:43 PM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- CRITICAL: Fixing automation - structure files not updating with current dates
- Debugging why GitHub Actions runs but doesn't update cmv-structure
- Need working automation to continue development through Claude


## ✅ Completed Today:
- Created GitHub Actions workflow file
- Set up Personal Access Token
- Added STRUCTURE_PAT secret to repository
- Workflow triggers and runs (shows in Actions tab)
- Manual structure generation works locally


## 🔄 In Progress:
- Debugging why automation doesn't push updates
- Investigating GitHub Actions permission issues
- Trying to get PROJECT_STATUS.md to show current date


## ❌ Still Need:
- Fix automation to actually update cmv-structure repo
- Verify structure files update automatically
- Get current timestamps in PROJECT_STATUS.md
- Then: Initialize database, implement homepage, etc.


## 🐛 Active Issues:
- **BLOCKER**: Automation runs but cmv-structure not updating
- Structure files still show July 29, 2025 timestamps
- GitHub Actions shows failed status
- Manual generation works but auto-push failing
- Can't continue development via Claude until fixed


## 📁 Files Changed:
- .github/workflows/update-structure.yml (created but not working properly)
- Manual structure generation works locally
- cmv-structure repo not receiving updates


## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: Debug GitHub Actions logs, fix automation pipeline


## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- Add GitHub Actions status badge to README
- Create structure diff viewer to see what changed
- Add automation health check endpoint
- Implement structure update notifications
- Create backup automation using GitHub Apps
- Add structure validation before commit
- Add camera comparison tool (mentioned 11/14)
- Bulk upload for multiple cameras (discussed as future feature)
- API endpoint for developers (user expressed interest)
- Auto-detect camera from uploaded image (cool but complex)
- Price history tracking (would help users)
- Add "Camera Timeline" showing evolution of each brand's cameras
- Implement camera comparison tool (select 2-3 cameras side by side)
- Add user authentication for saving favorite cameras
- Create API for developers to access camera database
- Add price tracking to show historical prices
- Import cameras from CSV for bulk additions
- Add "Similar Cameras" recommendation engine
- Create mobile app version
- Add user reviews/ratings for cameras
- Integrate with YouTube for camera review videos
- Add manual PDF viewer directly in browser
- Create camera comparison matrix export feature
- Add automated structure monitoring dashboard
- Implement GitHub Actions status badges
- Add camera rental price tracking
- Create "Camera of the Month" voting system

- CSS Classes: 47
- Structure System: IMPLEMENTED ✅

## 📊 Automation Checklist:
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow created
- [x] Repository secret STRUCTURE_PAT added
- [x] Workflow triggers on push
- [x] Manual structure generation works
- [ ] Files push to cmv-structure automatically
- [ ] Structure files show current timestamp
- [ ] PROJECT_STATUS.md auto-updates


## 🔧 Debugging Steps Needed:
1. Check GitHub Actions error logs
2. Verify PAT has correct permissions
3. Test git push manually from workflow
4. Check if structure files are being generated
5. Verify commit and push commands in workflow


## 📝 Important Notes:
- Automation is the critical path for Claude development
- Without working automation, can't see current project state
- Manual generation confirms scripts work
- Issue is with GitHub Actions push step
- Need to solve this before continuing feature work
