## 📊 Automation Checklist:
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow created
- [x] Repository secret STRUCTURE_PAT added
- [x] Workflow triggers on push
- [x] Manual structure generation works
- [x] Git config issue identified and fixed

- [x] New PAT created with workflow permissions
- [x] STRUCTURE_PAT secret updated
- [ ] Test workflow run
- [ ] Verify files push to cmv-structure automatically
- [ ] Confirm structure files show current timestamp


## 🔧 Fix Summary:
Issues resolved:
1. Git config was using placeholder email → Fixed with bot credentials
2. PAT was missing workflow permission → New token created with correct permissions
3. Push command needed explicit branch → Updated to specify HEAD:main


## 📝 Important Notes:
- New PAT "CMV Structure Auto" created with both repo and workflow permissions
- Ready to test by either pushing a commit or manually triggering workflow
- Once confirmed working, development can resume at full speed
- The automation system is well-designed and should work smoothly now


## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps:
1. Commit this PROJECT_STATUS.md update
2. Watch GitHub Actions to see if automation triggers
3. Check cmv-structure repo for updated timestamps
4. Celebrate when it works! 🎉
