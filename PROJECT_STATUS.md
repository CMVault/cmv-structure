## 📝 Important Notes:
- **Discovery Working**: System is successfully finding cameras!
- **Database Schema**: Using 52-column schema with proper names
- **PM2 Restarts**: High restart count (47) due to syntax error
- **Mock Data**: Currently using mock data, need to implement real scraping
- **Next Fix**: Remove extra closing braces at line 322
- **Design Ready**: All gradients and brand colors defined


## 🤖 Current System Status:
```
DISCOVERY STATUS:
├── Status           🟡 RUNNING (with syntax errors)
├── Cameras Found    ✅ 6 per run
├── Daily Limit      200 cameras
├── Schedule         Every 4 hours
├── Backup           Daily at 3 AM
├── Current Issue    Syntax error line 322
└── PM2 Restarts     47 (due to error)

QUICK CHECKS:
# Count cameras in database
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cameras;"

# View recent cameras
sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT id, brand, model FROM cameras ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Check PM2 status
npx pm2 list

# Monitor logs
npx pm2 logs cmv-discovery --lines 50
```


## 🎯 Immediate Actions Needed:
1. Check if cameras are saved: `sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cameras;"`
2. Fix syntax error: Remove extra `});` at line 322
3. Implement real web scraping to replace mock data
4. Add error recovery to prevent constant restarts


## 🏆 Today's Achievements:
