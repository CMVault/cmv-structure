- Confirmed all core systems are in place


## 🔄 In Progress:
- Monitoring cmv-structure repository for automatic updates
- Validating PROJECT_STATUS.md auto-update functionality
- Testing end-to-end automation cycle


## ❌ Still Need:
- Confirm structure files appear in cmv-structure repo
- Verify GitHub Actions trigger on push
- Test that metrics auto-update correctly
- Validate all structure analysis files generate properly


## 🐛 Active Issues:
- None currently - structure script issue was resolved


## 📁 Files Changed:
- scripts/generate-structure.js (fixed - removed sharp, sqlite3, and other server-only imports)


## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: Push a test commit to trigger structure generation and verify cmv-structure repo populates


## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- Add camera comparison tool (mentioned 11/14)
- Bulk upload for multiple cameras (discussed as future feature)
- API endpoint for developers (user expressed interest)
- Auto-detect camera from uploaded image (cool but complex)
- Price history tracking (would help users)
- Add "Camera Timeline" showing evolution of each brand's cameras
- Implement camera comparison tool (select 2-3 cameras side by side)
- Add user authentication for saving favorite cameras
- Create API for developers to access camera database
- Add price tracking to show historical prices
- Import cameras from CSV for bulk additions
- Add "Similar Cameras" recommendation engine
- Create mobile app version
- Add user reviews/ratings for cameras
- Integrate with YouTube for camera review videos
- Add manual PDF viewer directly in browser
- Create camera comparison matrix export feature

## 🔧 Structure System Details:
Expected files in cmv-structure repo after automation:
- STRUCTURE.json (complete file tree with metadata)
- FILE_MAP.md (human-readable project map)
- CSS_GUIDE.md (CSS sections with line numbers)
- API_ROUTES.md (all endpoints documented)
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md (key info at a glance)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md (auto-updated status)


## 📝 Important Notes:
- Structure generation now uses only fs, path, and child_process modules
- GitHub Actions should trigger on every push to main branch
- Structure repo designed to stay under 1% capacity
- All changes tracked automatically with timestamps
- System ready for production use once verified
