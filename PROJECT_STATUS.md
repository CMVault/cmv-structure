# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault


## Last Updated: August 3, 2025 at 4:58 PM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- ✅ Successfully implemented CMV automation system
- ✅ Automation is running and attempting to scrape cameras
- 🔧 Fixing database schema issues (missing manual_url column)
- 🔧 Addressing 403 errors from web scraping attempts


## ✅ Completed Today:
- **Automation System Deployment**:
  - Successfully installed node-cron dependency
  - Created all automation files (cmv-automation.js, automation-routes.js, automation-monitor.html)
  - Integrated automation routes into server.js
  - Created required directories (backups, attributions, cache)
  - Automation system successfully initializes and runs

- **Initial Testing Results**:
  - Automation connects to database ✅
  - Scraping attempts execute for all 20 cameras ✅
  - Monitor dashboard accessible at /automation-monitor ✅
  - Encountered expected 403 errors (no real scraping logic yet)
  - Discovered missing database column (manual_url)


## 🔄 In Progress:
- Fixing database schema (need to add manual_url column)
- Creating safe version with placeholder data
- Implementing real web scraping logic


## ❌ Still Need:
- Add manual_url column to database
- Implement real scraping logic or use placeholder approach
- Test with successful camera additions
- Verify cameras appear on website
- Set up production scraping with proper headers


## 🐛 Active Issues:
- **SQLITE ERROR: no such column: manual_url** - Need to add column
- **403 Forbidden errors** - Scraping attempts blocked (expected without proper implementation)
- Database query in getDatabaseStats needs updating


## 📁 Files Changed:
- Created: `cmv-automation.js` ✅
- Created: `automation-monitor.html` ✅
- Created: `automation-routes.js` ✅
- Updated: `server.js` (added automation integration) ✅
- Updated: `package.json` (added node-cron) ✅
- Need to create: `cmv-automation-safe.js` (placeholder version)


## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: 
1. Fix database: `sqlite3 data/camera-vault.db "ALTER TABLE cameras ADD COLUMN manual_url TEXT;"`
2. Create safe version: `cp cmv-automation.js cmv-automation-safe.js`
3. Update scraping logic to use placeholders
4. Run safe version: `node cmv-automation-safe.js`
5. Check results in monitor and cameras page


## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- Add "Camera Timeline" showing evolution of each brand's cameras
- Implement camera comparison tool (select 2-3 cameras side by side)
- Add user authentication for saving favorite cameras
- Create API for developers to access camera database
- Add price tracking to show historical prices
- Import cameras from CSV for bulk additions
- Add "Similar Cameras" recommendation engine
- Create mobile app version
- Add user reviews/ratings for cameras
- Integrate with YouTube for camera review videos
- Add camera repair guides section
- Implement QR code scanner to identify cameras
- Create virtual camera museum with 3D models
- Add lens compatibility database
- Build community marketplace for used cameras
- Add camera rental price tracking
- Create "Camera of the Day" feature
- Implement camera specification comparison charts
- Add firmware download links
- Create camera timeline visualizations
- Add dark mode toggle
- Implement PWA features for offline access
- Add AI-powered camera identification from photos
- Create camera gear calculator (weight, cost, compatibility)
- Implement automated eBay price tracking
- Add camera sensor size visualization tool
- Create shareable camera kit builder
- **NEW: Implement proper web scraping with headers and delays**
- **NEW: Add proxy support for scraping**
- **NEW: Create manual upload interface for PDFs**


## 📝 Important Notes:
- Automation system is functional but needs fixes for production use
- 403 errors are expected - need proper scraping implementation
- Database schema mismatch discovered - easy fix required
- Monitor dashboard working perfectly
- System architecture is solid, just needs data fixes


## 🤖 Current Automation Status:
- **System**: Running but encountering errors
- **Cameras Attempted**: 20
- **Successful Additions**: 0 (due to 403 errors)
- **Database Errors**: 1 (missing column)
- **Next Scheduled Run**: 6 hours from initialization


## 📊 Error Summary:
```
- Scraping Errors: 403 Forbidden (all sources)
- Database Error: no such column: manual_url
- Affected cameras: All 20 in queue
```


## 🛠️ Quick Fixes Needed:
1. **Database Fix**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE cameras ADD COLUMN manual_url TEXT;
   ```

2. **Placeholder Approach**:
   - Skip real web scraping for now
   - Use generated data to test system
   - Add real scraping later with proper implementation


## 🚦 Overall Status: YELLOW 🟡
- Core system: ✅ Working
- Automation framework: ✅ Functional
- Data collection: ❌ Needs fixes
- Monitor dashboard: ✅ Operational
- Ready for fixes then full deployment
